# Tutorial: The Proper ArchAI Flow

To get the most out of ArchAI, it is best to follow a structured analysis-to-action pipeline. This ensures your decisions are evidence-based and risk-mitigated.

## Recommended Sequence

1.  **AUDIT**: Perform a holistic scan of your project to identify foundational issues and opportunities.
2.  **TRACE**: Drill into specific audit findings to see the evidence trail in your code.
3.  **IMPACT**: Assess the technical risk of making specific changes to core components.
4.  **PLAN**: Decompose your improvement goals into a detailed, prioritized sprint plan.
5.  **SIMULATE**: Validate the plan's feasibility using probabilistic simulation before committing. You can simulate an entire goal or just a specific **Ticket ID** (e.g., `SIMULATE WDP-1`).

## Why this flow?

- **Audit** finds *what* is wrong.
- **Trace** proves *why* it's wrong.
- **Impact** predicts *how* fixing it affects the rest of the system.
- **Plan** organizes the *how-to-fix*.
- **Simulate** confirms the *likelihood of success*.
