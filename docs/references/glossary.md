### CIRAS
**Change Impact & Risk Assessment**. The agent responsible for deterministic risk mapping.

### WDP-TG
**Work Decomposition & Prioritized Task Generation**. The agent responsible for breaking down goals into tasks.

### SRC-RS
**Sprint & Release Confidence Engine**. The simulation engine for predicting project outcomes.

### GraphEngine
The core deterministic engine that parses ASTs and Git history to build the architectural map.

### Blast Radius
The set of all components affected by a change to a single symbol or file.

### Fan-in
The number of external components that import or call a specific module. High fan-in implies high risk.

### Churn
The frequency of commits to a specific file. High churn often correlates with architectural instability.
