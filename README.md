# ArchAI: Autonomous Architect 🏗️

**SaaS-Ready AI Agent Orchestration for Codebase Mapping & Sprint Planning**

ArchAI is a professional-grade architectural auditing system that transforms raw codebases into actionable, high-fidelity development roadmaps. Using a chained workflow of seven specialized AI agents, it provides deep structural insight and prioritized task management.

## 🚀 The 7-Agent Orchestration Pipeline

ArchAI operates on a rigorous, sequential chain of seven specialized intelligence agents:

1. **Path Navigator 🧭**: Resolves user input into safe, absolute filesystem paths across Windows, Mac, and Linux (starting from $HOME if needed).
2. **Discovery Agent 🔍**: Maps project structure and detects tech-stack metadata (Languages, Frameworks, Architecture Patterns).
3. **Context Builder 🧱**: Analyzes discovery data to build a dependency graph and identify critical execution paths.
4. **Gap Analyzer 📋**: Compares the current codebase against your "Target State" goals to identify technical debt and missing features.
5. **Ticket Generator 🎫**: Converts gaps into detailed, machine-parsable development tickets with severity and effort estimations.
6. **Sprint Planner 📅**: Uses a balanced scheduling algorithm to build a prioritized 5-day sprint plan.
7. **Auditor & Verifier ✅**: Performs a final risk assessment, ensuring task feasibility and merging quality notes into the roadmap.

## 🛠️ Usage (Professional CLI)

ArchAI supports both a guided interactive wizard and a headless CLI for CI/CD integration.

### Orchestrated Audit Command
Run a full 7-agent audit on any project:
```bash
ai-architect audit /path/to/project --context "Modernizing legacy API" --goal "Production-ready REST API"
```

> **⚠️ Path Navigation Note:**
> Users on **macOS/Ubuntu** should provide full absolute paths starting with `/Users/<username>/` (macOS) or `/home/<username>/` (Linux) to ensure the Path Navigator agent correctly resolves the target directory.

### Options & Observability
- `--verbose`: Show real-time agent execution logs and latency metrics.
- `--diagnostics`: Run a filesystem scan only (no AI) to verify path readability.
- `--model`: Specify your preferred Ollama model (Default: `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud`).

### Iterative Test Loop
Improve test coverage autonomously:
```bash
ai-architect test
```

## 💎 Premium Features
- **Cross-Platform Stability**: Native support for Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu/Linux using specialized path navigation agents.
- **Machine-Parsable Output**: Produces a `sprint-plan.json` ready for consumption by Web UIs or external APIs.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Context-aware reasoning for every architectural decision.
- **Self-Monitoring**: The orchestrator tracks agent performance and latency for stability analysis.
